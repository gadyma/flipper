# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Thank you for using Web Page Direction Toggler! This extension allows users to toggle the text direction of any webpage between left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users of this extension. The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not communicate with any external servers.

## Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly:
- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension icon. This is necessary to toggle the text direction of the active webpage.
- **scripting**: Allows the extension to inject CSS styles into the active tab's webpage. This is crucial for changing the text direction of the content displayed on the page.

These permissions are solely used for the functionality of the extension and do not result in any data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
